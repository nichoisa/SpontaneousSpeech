# SpontaneousSpeech
Script for processing coded experimenter-infant interactions
Part of the BabyRhythm project

These files are used to process files exported from Praat in which an experimenter has coded an experimenter-child interaction. It provides summary values for outcomes such as mean length of utterance, infant rate of speech (in syllables per second), and the length of between-speaker pauses.
